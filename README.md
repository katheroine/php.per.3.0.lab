# PHP.PER.3.0.lab

Laboratory of PER Coding Style 3.0.

> This repository is a standalone part of a larger project: **[PHP.lab](https://github.com/katheroine/php.lab)** — a curated knowledge base and laboratory for PHP engineering.

**Usage**

To run the example application with *Docker* use command:

```console
docker compose up -d
```

After creating the *Docker container* the *Composer dependencies* have to be defined and installed:

```console
docker compose exec application composer require --dev squizlabs/php_codesniffer \
&& docker compose exec application composer install
```

Tom make *PHP Code Sniffer commands* easily accessible run:

```console
docker compose exec application ln -s /var/www/vendor/bin/phpcs /usr/local/bin/phpcs \
&& docker compose exec application ln -s /var/www/vendor/bin/phpcbf /usr/local/bin/phpcbf
```

To run *PHP Code Sniffer* use command:

```console
docker compose exec application /var/www/vendor/bin/phpcs
```

or, if the shortcut has been created:

```console
docker compose exec application phpcs
```

To update `Composer dependencies` use command (should be done before the command below):

```console
docker compose exec application composer update
